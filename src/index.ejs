                    <p>What is now the bustling metropolis of Mumbai was a scattered group of islands just a few centuries ago.
                    The accounts, legends and facts surrounding its
                     150-plus years of reclaiming land from the sea is a reminder of how this came to be known as “the City of Dreams.”</p>
                     <p>In the mid-17th century, Bombay was a collection of seven major islands, some of which were highly historic—the Isle of Bombay, Colaba, 
                        Old Womans Island, Mahim, Mazagaon, Parel, and Worli. So when the British took control of Bombay from the Portuguese in 1665,
                        in hopes of using the strategic area to generate wealth, they found less than 20 square miles of land in their possession.</p>

                    <p>The economic capital of India is growing at high speed and will need major interventions to at least double its urban land area by the end of the century. 
                        Until 2020, 385.6 km2 of territory had been generated by land reclamation techniques in the area of the Mumbai peninsula, and the forecast for this century 
                        is to reach 1,000 km2, basically intervening in the area of Mumbai Bay, which means that there is still a missing of 600 km2 to be developed, giving opportunity 
                        to new technical interventions that offer solutions for medium depth and master plans that are capable of integrating sustainable growth.</p>
